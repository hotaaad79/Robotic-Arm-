# Robotic Arm Control using STM32

## Overview

This project controls a 4-DOF robotic arm using STM32 microcontroller.

The robotic arm can be controlled using two different modes:

- Joystick Control Mode
- Potentiometer Control Mode

---

## Features

- Control 4 Servo Motors
- Dual Control Mode
- Smooth and precise movement
- Real-time control

---

## Hardware Components

- STM32 Microcontroller
- Servo Motors (4)
- Joysticks (2)
- Potentiometers
- Power Supply

---

## Software Tools

- STM32CubeIDE
- Embedded C

---

## Hardware Implementation

The circuit was fully implemented by soldering all components and wires on a perfboard (donut board) to ensure reliable and permanent connections.

---

## PCB Design

The PCB was designed using KiCad, but it was not fabricated.

---

## Control Modes

### Mode 1 – Joystick

Each joystick controls two motors.

### Mode 2 – Potentiometer

Each potentiometer controls one motor.
